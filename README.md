Sort and filter and sort a (large) .bib file

# `fsbib.sh`
The script can:
* sort a `.bib` file, based on the entry keys
* filter a `.bib` file: returns a new, smaller `.bib` file, containing only the entries cited in a given `.tex` file

Usage
1) `chmod u+x` to make this script executable
2) `/fsbib.sh [-fs] bibfile [texfile] [output_bibfile]` and then follow the instructions
